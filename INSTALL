HuExpress installation instructions
===================================

Linux development environment
===================================

You need :
- gcc (gcc-3.0 or later) or clang
- scons
- libzip development libraries

Those are very common and you likely already have them.

- sdl2 development library
- sdl2_mixer development library
- libvorbis development library

Then, run 'scons' to begin the build process.

At the moment, there is no automated installation.
For now there is one binary you need to worry about:
HuExpress.

Haiku development environment
===================================

Most of the Haiku installation is handeled by
a recipe at HaikuPorts. However:

You need :
- scons
- gcc verson 4 or gcc_x86

You need gcc4 versions of:
- sdl2_devel
- sdl2
- sdl2_mixer
- sdl2_mixer_devel
- libzip
- libvorbis
- libvorbis_devel

Windows development environment
===================================

You need to grab the native mingw environment and msys (so you get a shell,
a compiler, make, ...) (see www.mingw.org, install mingw and then msys).

You need to grab the sdl development libraty for mingw on www.libsdl.org.
Install it in the mingw directory (so that SDL.h is in the include subdirectory
of the mingw main directory, etc ..)

FreeBSD development environment
===============================

See the linux notes.
A few details : sdl config script is called slightly differently (sdl2-config).
You can simply make a link called sdl-config toward it. It should be the only
difference with the linux instructions.
