  with F1.
When in disassembler mode, if can't go up one line w/o illegal instructs,

Now, the minimum machine is a pentium (Once more, I don't think I denigrate
  a lot of people and we gain a bit a speed, if needed I could make a 486 version)
Better commented sources (It's an habit, now;)

Changes from HU-GO! 0.93 to HU-GO! 0.94

Big changes in the philosophy of Hu-Go!, now you will also find features for
  PC Engine game creators. But don't worry, the main goal is still to
  run most roms as well as I can ;)
So now, there's a disassembler and a RAM editor.
One can freeze a value in RAM

  favorite screen mode (try -v1 if you got an 'flag' effect on screen)
Little delay added between two command keys (eg. inc/dec frame rate...)
  to avoid multiple key pressed
Message displayed on the bottom left
Working synchronisation (In fact, limitation to 60 frame / sec.)
More roms recognized (519)
Cleaner code (I'm still waiting for help)
Slightly faster (almost imperceptible)
